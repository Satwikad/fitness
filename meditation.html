                    <h2>Focus on what you're feeling.</h2>
                    <p>Breath naturally and notice the feelings and sensations that you experience as you breathe in and out. Focusing on your breath is a good choice since it is usually the entry point to any meditation practice.Feeling discouraged may prevent you from sticking with it.</p>
