                       3. Take deep controlled breaths while maintaining tension throughout your entire body, so your abs, shoulders, triceps, glutes and quads are all engaged.<br><br>

                    <h1>PUSHUPS</h1>
                    <p>1. Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.<br><br>
                       2. Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.<br><br>
                       3. Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.<br><br>
                       If you can’t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees you’ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength.</p>
